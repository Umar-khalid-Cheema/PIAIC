/* The code is an example of how to change a guest list for a dinner event. It starts by declaring an
array called `guest_name` with the names of the guests. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate over
the `guest_name` array and print a message for each guest, inviting them to the dinner. */
// Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

console.log(guest_name);

    const element = guest_name[index];
    console.log(
        `Hello ${guest_name[index]}!\nI invited you to come on dinner.\nThank You`
      );

//Now, one of our guest can't come on dinner
let new_guest_list:string[]=guest_name.splice(2,1);

    console.log(
        `Hello ${guest_name[index]}!\nI invited you to come on dinner.\nThank You`

// console.log(
//   `Hello ${guest_name[0]}!\nI invited you to come on dinner.\nThank You`

//   `Hello ${guest_name[0]}!\nI invited you to come on dinner.\nThank You`
// );
// console.log(
//   `Hello ${guest_name[1]}!\nI invited you to come on dinner.\nThank You`

// console.log(
