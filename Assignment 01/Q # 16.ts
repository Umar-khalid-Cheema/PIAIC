/* The code is written in TypeScript and it represents a program that handles a dinner invitation list. */
// 16. More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
//  • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
